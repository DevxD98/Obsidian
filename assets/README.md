## Logo Files

Place your logo files here:

- **logo.png** - Your main logo (any size, preferably 1024x1024 or larger)
- **icon.icns** - macOS app icon (will be generated)
- **icon.ico** - Windows app icon (will be generated)
- **icon.png** - Linux app icon (512x512 recommended)

## How to Add Your Logo:

1. Copy your PNG logo to this folder and name it `logo.png`
2. Run `npm run generate-icons` (after we set it up) to create platform-specific icons

## Icon Sizes Needed:

For best results, your logo.png should be:

- Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- At least 1024x1024 pixels
- Transparent background (PNG with alpha channel)
- Simple, clear design that works at small sizes

Once you add your logo, we'll generate all the platform-specific icons automatically!
