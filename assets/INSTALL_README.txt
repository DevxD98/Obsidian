  OBSIDIAN BROWSER - Installation Instructions
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📦 HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Drag "Obsidian Browser" to the Applications folder
2. Close this window


⚠️  IMPORTANT - First Time Opening:

macOS will block the app because it's not from the App Store.
This is normal and safe!

TO OPEN THE APP:

Method 1 (Recommended):
• Go to Applications folder
• RIGHT-CLICK on "Obsidian Browser"
• Select "Open"
• Click "Open" in the dialog
• Done! The app is now trusted

Method 2:
• Try to open the app normally (will fail)
• Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security
• Click "Open Anyway" next to the blocked app message
• Enter your password

Method 3 (Terminal):
• Open Terminal
• Run: xattr -cr "/Applications/Obsidian Browser.app"

Need help? This is a common macOS security feature.
All apps not signed with a paid Apple Developer certificate
($99/year) are blocked this way.

Obsidian Browser is safe and open source!
