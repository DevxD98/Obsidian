## Your Build Files

### macOS

Location: `dist/`

- **`Obsidian Browser-1.0.0-universal.dmg`** (199 MB) - Recommended! Works on ALL Macs
- **`Obsidian Browser-1.0.0.dmg`** (116 MB) - Intel Macs only
- **`Obsidian Browser-1.0.0-arm64.dmg`** (111 MB) - Apple Silicon only
- **`Obsidian Browser-1.0.0-universal-mac.zip`** (199 MB) - Zip alternative

### For Your Friends on Windows

Build Windows versions with:

```bash
npm run build:win64  # 64-bit only (faster build)
# OR
npm run build:win    # Both 32-bit and 64-bit
```

This will create in `dist/`:

- **`Obsidian Browser-1.0.0-x64.exe`** - 64-bit installer (most common)
- **`Obsidian Browser-1.0.0-ia32.exe`** - 32-bit installer (older PCs)
- **`Obsidian Browser-1.0.0-portable.exe`** - Portable version

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Build for macOS (what you just did)
npm run build:mac

# Build for Windows (do this next!)
npm run build:win64

# Build for all platforms
npm run build:all

# Run in development
npm start
```

## Testing the Icon

### On Your Mac:

1. Open `dist/Obsidian Browser-1.0.0-universal.dmg`

## File Sharing Options

**Best for large files (200MB+):**

1. **Google Drive** - Upload and share link
2. **Dropbox** - Upload and share link
3. **WeTransfer** - wetransfer.com (free, 2GB limit)
4. **GitHub Releases** - If you have a repo

**Example Google Drive sharing:**

## Security Notes

Since the app isn't code-signed (that costs $$), users will see warnings:

### macOS Users:

- First time: Right-click app → Open → Click "Open"
- Or: System Preferences → Security → "Open Anyway"

### Windows Users:

- SmartScreen warning: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- This is normal for unsigned apps!

### Want to remove warnings?

- **macOS**: Get Apple Developer Certificate ($99/year)
- **Windows**: Get code signing certificate ($200-500/year)
